# Define the variables for principal, rate, and time
principal = 1000  
rate = 0.05       
time = 3          

# Calculate the simple interest using the formula: interest = principal * rate * time
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the calculated interest in the specified format
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
